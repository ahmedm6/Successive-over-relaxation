# Successive-over-relaxation
In numerical linear algebra, the method of successive over-relaxation (SOR) is a variant of the Gaussâ€“Seidel method for solving a linear system of equations, resulting in faster convergence.

This project explores the iterative linear solving processes of SOR to analyze a diffusive process. Given the diffusive process is in an infinitely thin domain of length L, the problem represents the diffusion of heat at any point within L.

To numerically approximate this process, we can divide [0, L] into (n + 1) equally spaced points, 
and simulate the diffusion process by solving the linear system: Au = b 

SOR has initial applications in the petroleum engineering industry.
